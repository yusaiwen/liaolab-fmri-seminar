    "The image of MRI has two important peoperties, that is, spatial resolution and temporl resolution. Spatial resolution refers to the ability to distin- guish changes in an image (or map) across different spatial locations, whereas temporal resolution refers to the ability to distinguish changes in a signal (or map) across time.\n",
    "Simplely put it, smaller voxel size stands for higher spatial resolution, and faster collection of data stands for higher temporal resolution. Higher spatial resolution will make the image more fine(think of the difference of 720p and 1080p video), and higher temporal resolution will make the image capture faster differences(think of the difference of 30HZ and 60HZ video).\n",
    "The increment of spatial resolution will take more time to collect the data, resulting the decline of temporal resolution."

    "Indeed, smaller voxel size will give rise to higher spatial resolution of the image, which, however, will reduce SNR. The signal intensity is proportional to the total number of protons contained within a voxel. Large voxels, that contain more protons, emit stronger signals and result in less image noise. Unfortunately, as we have just discovered, large voxels reduce image detail. Therefore, when the factors for an imaging procedure are being selected, this compromise between signal-to-noise ratio and image detail must be considered. The major reason for imaging relatively thick slices is to increase the voxel signal intensity and it also allows shorter TE values.\n",
